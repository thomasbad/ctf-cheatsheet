                        Long Story Short: This website is being created because of my homework.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                        I 've get into a web design course and it required us to make a 6 pages website as assignment,
                        it contains very simple requirements which only required the students to put in their HTML5 standard
                        code with CSS only, and done that's it.
                        &nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb fa-bounce is-size-4"></i><br><br>
                        Then I realized why shouldn't I create a website I would use? As I usually needs to suffer for
                        looking into bunch of bookmarks and looking for stuff I needs
                        to use in CTF Game, I wonder maybe I should at least put a few very basic things which I
                        always needs to looking for into a single website instead,
                        so that I can at least remove a few bookmarks in my browser, and here it is.&nbsp;
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-spinner fa-spin is-size-5"></i><br><br>
                        If you found here just because you've googled hacking related stuff and it leads you to here, and
                        you're totally new in this field, I suggest you may really try to learn
                        Linux first, as most of the open sourced tools (and most of them are extremely amazing) goes to
                        there, with many well packaged distribution as well which
                        would be greatly convenient and friendly to newbie. You can play around and learn commands from here as I
                        think they do great by leading the newbies learning their
                        their basic command easily, and able to enjoy the whitehat gaming at the same time:

                                aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;OverTheWire: Bandit</a><br><br>
                        I am not sure if I will add more into the contents here as time is quite tight to finish all the stuff
                        I want to put in here, but I hope it can be done slowly
                        in the future, and would be helpful for some CTF newbies there. <br><br>
